I want to show you something. It's a Makefile, for a popular open-source library that you
may have heard of called jQuery. It's not all that popular these days, but there was a
time where it and JavaScript were basically synonymous. I knew serious, talented,
professional developers back in 2010 who had never bootstrapped a project on their own,
and thought that jQuery was just always there; a part of the platform.<br />
Back in 2010, <a href="https://github.com/jquery/jquery/blob/9bd9ebdd73fe0e2d29fadf82947c98adde4023e7/Makefile">jQuery used <code>make</code></a>
as the tool with which it was built. I hesitate to call it an actual
build system, because all it really did was call <code>cat</code> (and Google's
<a href="https://developers.google.com/closure/compiler">Closure Compiler</a> for the minified
version), on a bunch of source files. I've modified it slightly for brevity and clarity,
but you can see the essence of it here:

I have a very sentimental attachment to <em>The Teenage Web</em>. That era of the Internet when
people were starting to get high-speed connections to their homes, when Facebook and
Twitter were just getting started, when choosing which email service you wanted to use was
a serious life decision, when having an iPod touch made you feel like one of the cool kids,
and when tools like jQuery, MooTools, and Prototype rained supreme.
</p>

<p>
I'd define <em>The Teenage Web</em> to be from about 2004 until around 2011. Now, by the year
2004, the Internet was hardly a literal teenager (with the conscencous being this it was
born in 1983, it was well into its 20's by the time I'm refering to) and if the above
description sounds like it's coming from a pretty specific perspective, it is. This period
of time is when I myself was coming into teenager-dom, and additionally when I first
started learning to program. The Internet still had a lose, somewhat chaotic, feel, but
was growing and maturing incredibly quickly. The web by now, has hit maturity, and I think
it's a version of maturity that many of us are not incredibly happy with.
<ul>
<li>Even simple websites will make you download their bundled version of React along with
7 versions of left-pad. Remember when large JavaScript libraries were pulled in from CDNs?</li>
<li>Tracking and cookie banners are everywhere. They'll happily let you opt-in to tracking
with a single click, but will require at least 4 or 5 if you'd rather not be tracked.</li>
<li>Paywalls, newsletter prompts, memberships, logins; everyone wants a piece of your
wallet or identify. Preferably both. Wouldn't it be awful if you missed out on an opportunity
to be a consumer?</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
It's a mess for users, but things are worse for developers now as well! When I was first
learning to program, learning HTML and CSS felt like enough to be able to build a website,
but people learning today need to understand the differences between JavaScript and TypeScript,
how to use frameworks like Vue or React, and how to build/bundle their code into a form fit
for delivery to users. Should they use an "all-in-one" solution like Next.js, or should they
use something like ESBuild or Vite? What's the difference anyway? Additionally, they need
to pick a way to host their website using something like Vercel, Netlify, or even worse,
something more complicated like Fly.io, Heroku, or <em>*shudders*</em> AWS.
</p>

<p>
All of my oldest websites were just HTML, CSS, and maybe a little JavaScript. More recently,
I yearn for
</p>

<p>
The web used to be fun. It used to be open, accessable, and for everyone. I miss the days
when everyone was just vibing, having a good time, experimenting and trying to push the
limits of the technology for good, not evil.
