<p>I want to show you something. It's a build script from 2010, for a popular open-source JavaScript library that you may have heard of called jQuery. It's not all that popular these days, but there was a time where it and JavaScript were basically synonymous.<br />
Back in 2010, jQuery used <code>make</code></a> to put itself together. I hesitate to call it a build system, or even a bundler, because all it did was call <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cat_(Unix)"><code>cat</code></a> (and Google's <a href="https://developers.google.com/closure/compiler">Closure Compiler</a> to optimize code size), on a bunch of source files. I've modified the <a href="https://github.com/jquery/jquery/blob/9b20df0375f37cc0997bd8ed3d1892a23967d3d5/Makefile">original Makefile</a> slightly for brevity and clarity, but I've done my best to preserve the essence:

<cite><a href="https://github.com/jquery/jquery/blob/9b20df0375f37cc0997bd8ed3d1892a23967d3d5/Makefile">github.com/jquery/jquery</a> â€” The jQuery Code repository, as of v1.4.4</cite>

<p>I know Makefile syntax isn't the most friendly on first glance, but the core concept is incredibly simple. You have input files, and you have output files. Your Makefile is a list of output files, followed by the steps (shell commands) needed to make that file. You can also list <em>fake files</em> (<code>.PHONY</code>) to help tie everything together. <code>make</code> doesn't even know what JavaScript is, and it doesn't need to. The great thing about using <code>make</code> to build jQuery, was that it reused an existing tool that people were likely to already have installed on their systems. I had it on my MacBook back then, without even really know what it was. It wasn't without compromises, however! In computer science, the only way that a tool becomes as prolific as <code>make</code> is by being old, and <em>riddled</em> with compromises. For starters, using <code>make</code> on Windows is a much worse experience, and that's only when it's not out-right broken.
</p>

<p>This sort of simplicity extended to using jQuery as well. If you wanted to use jQuery on your website, all you had to do was add a <code>&lt;script&gt;</code> tag to your HTML. You could either download a copy of jQuery from their website to include alongside your own code, or you could use of a number of CDNs which hosted various versions of jQuery. (Spoiler alert, The Teenage Web is a modern take on this.)

<hr />

<notes>ok, so maybe rather than some "appeal to tradition" bullshit, I should lean into more of a "start swinging the pendulum back" type of thing, saying "maybe we over corrected, and some of what we've come to is interesting, but a lot of it just isn't really working out imo."
actually, you know what? fuck trying to say anything at all, what if it was just a cool retro throw-back to an era of web development that has kind of been lost to time?
</notes>

<p>I have a very sentimental attachment to <em>The Teenage Web</em>. That era of the Internet when people were starting to get high-speed connections to their homes, when Facebook and
Twitter were just getting started, when choosing which email service you wanted to use was
a serious life decision, when having an iPod touch made you feel like one of the cool kids,
and when tools like jQuery, MooTools, and Prototype rained supreme.
</p>

<p>
I'd define <em>The Teenage Web</em> to be roughly from 2004 to 2012. Now, by the year
2004, the Internet was hardly a literal teenager (with the consensus being this it was
born in 1983, it was well into its 20's by the time I'm refering to) and if the above
description sounds like it's coming from a pretty specific perspective, it is. This period
of time is when I myself was coming into teenager-dom, and additionally when I first
started learning to program. The Internet still had a lose, somewhat chaotic, feel, but
was growing and maturing incredibly quickly. The web by now, has hit maturity, and I think
it's a version of maturity that many of us are not incredibly happy with.
<ul>
<li>Even simple websites will make you download their bundled version of React along with
7 versions of left-pad. Remember when large JavaScript libraries were pulled in from CDNs?</li>
<li>Tracking and cookie banners are everywhere. They'll happily let you opt-in to tracking
with a single click, but will require at least 4 or 5 if you'd rather not be tracked.</li>
<li>Paywalls, newsletter prompts, memberships, logins; everyone wants a piece of your
wallet or identify. Preferably both. Wouldn't it be awful if you missed out on an opportunity
to be a consumer?</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>Just forward to today (2024), and it's a very different story. Instead of <code>make</code>, we tend to use tools that are <em>much</em> more complicated,
</p>

<p>
It's a mess for users, but things are worse for developers now as well! When I was first
learning to program, learning HTML and CSS felt like enough to be able to build a website,
but people learning today need to understand the differences between JavaScript and TypeScript,
how to use frameworks like Vue or React, and how to build/bundle their code into a form fit
for delivery to users. Should they use an "all-in-one" solution like Next.js, or should they
use something like ESBuild or Vite? What's the difference anyway? Additionally, they need
to pick a way to host their website using something like Vercel, Netlify, or even worse,
something more complicated like Fly.io, Heroku, or <em>*shudders*</em> AWS.
</p>

<p>
All of my oldest websites were just HTML, CSS, and maybe a little JavaScript. More recently,
I yearn for
</p>

<p>
The web used to be fun. It used to be open, accessable, and for everyone. I miss the days
when everyone was just vibing, having a good time, experimenting and trying to push the
limits of the technology for good, not evil.
